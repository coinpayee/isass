# isass

`isass` (Indented SASS) compiles [SASS-indented-syntax](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.INDENTED_SYNTAX.html) 
into CSS or SCSS. 


 `isass` uses [pyScss](https://github.com/Kronuz/pyScss) as its internal compiler, to compile `scss` to `css`. so `isass` is a `sass` to `scss` convertor, including: 

* A watchdog to automatically reproduce output.css when one or more source files are changed.
* A command line interfaces 


## Installation
